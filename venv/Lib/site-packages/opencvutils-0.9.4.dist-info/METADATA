# OpenCV Utilities

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/opencvutils.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencvutils/)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/opencvutils.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencvutils/)

This is a set of OpenCV utilities that should make working with OpenCV a
little easier. I forked this and added somethings for a class I taught in Spring
2018. You should probably use Adrian's library, link below.

**Original Author:** Adrian Rosebrock

**Original Name:** [imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils)

## Install

The preferred way to install is using `pip`:

    pip install opencvutils

### Other Libraries

You will need both `numpy` and `opencv3` for this to work. Use your os
package manager to install. Unfortunately this is not fast, `numpy`
install involves compiling things, so go grab a coffee or something
while you wait.

for macOS (please be aware, the `brew` people keep changing this!):

    pip install numpy
    brew install opencv

## Development

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/walchko/opencvutils
    cd opencvutils
    pip install -e .

## Documentation

See the [Jupyter
Notebooks](https://github.com/walchko/opencvutils/tree/master/docs) for
examples of how to use this library. It contains a lot of common image
manipulations.

### Video Encoding

You can make a video like this:

```python
import cv2
from opencvutils.Camera import SaveVideo

shape = (240,320)  # rows (height), cols (width)
sv = SaveVideo()

# you can change the default encoder using a four_cc
# string, but not all of them work!
# sv.encoder('H264')
# sv.encoder('MP4V')
# sv.encoder('x264')

sv.open(filename, shape[1], shape[0])  # order is backwards from opencv!!!

for i in range(100):
    ret, img = camera.read()  # grab image
    sv.write(img)

sv.release()
```

### Scripts

``` {.sourceCode .bash
pi@raspberry ~ $ mjpeg_server.py -h
    usage: mjpeg_server.py [-h] [-v] [-p PORT] [-c CAMERA] [-t TYPE]
                                             [-s SIZE SIZE]

    A simple mjpeg server Example: mjpeg-server -p 8080 --camera 4

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
    -p PORT, --port PORT  mjpeg publisher port, default is 9000
    -c CAMERA, --camera CAMERA
                                                set opencv camera number, ex. -c 1
    -t TYPE, --type TYPE  set camera type, either pi or cv, ex. -t pi
    -s SIZE SIZE, --size SIZE SIZE
                                                set size
```

Then you could do:

    pi@raspberry ~ $ mjpeg_server.py -t pi -s 640 480

now navigate to your computer (hostname:9000) and you should see the
mjpg stream. Note, if you changed the port number with the `-p` arg,
then use that port number.
